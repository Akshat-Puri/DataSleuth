# DataSleuth
I propose an enhanced data leakage detection technique to help users identify and trace the source of unauthorized data leaks. Often, sensitive information is discovered in unauthorized locations, such as unapproved laptops or websites. When this happens, it's crucial to determine the source of the leak. To address this, I introduce a method that involves strategically allocating data to different recipients, referred to as agents.

My approach allows users to distribute data among agents with subtle, undetectable alterations, each tagged with a unique identifier. These alterations enable the system to trace the origin of leaked data when it surfaces in unauthorized places. By associating data with specific agents, we can quickly identify the source of any leakage. The system is designed to detect data leaks in multiple formats, including .txt, .jpg, .bmp, and .pdf files.
